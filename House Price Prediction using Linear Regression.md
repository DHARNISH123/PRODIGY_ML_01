# PRODIGY_ML_01
# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a simple implementation of a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on features such as:

- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

It is part of the **Machine Learning Internship Task** for Prodigy Infotech.

## Project Description

We use a sample dataset with housing features to train a **Linear Regression model** using Python and `scikit-learn`. The goal is to predict house prices and evaluate the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- VS Code

## How It Works

1. Define a sample dataset with square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and price.
2. Split the data into training and test sets.
3. Train a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
4. Predict house prices on test data.
5. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
